# High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT)

High Mountain Asia (HMA), extending from the Hindu Kush and Tien Shan in the west to the Eastern Himalaya, is the world’s largest reservoir of perennial glaciers and snow outside of the Earth’s polar ice sheets. The region is home to a range of unique landforms, ecosystems, hazards, and cultures; and HMA supplies water to more than a billion people. Changes in the region’s glaciers, snow, permafrost, and precipitation patterns have altered this water supply, while also transforming regional ecology, land utilization practices, and the hazards associated with landslides and glacial-lake-outburst floods.

The goal of the NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT) is to use satellite remote sensing observations to characterize these changes, gain insight into the Earth system processes that control them, and inform decisions, management actions, and policy development. Additional information can be found on our [project page](http://himat.org).
